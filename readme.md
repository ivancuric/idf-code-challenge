IDF Frontend Code Challenge
===========================

## The excuses
A build process is present in order to showcase an example of a project architecture and to enable me to write the ES7 with backwards compatibility.

The original idea was to just write plain CSS and JS, like Surma and Paul did in [Supercharged](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkXZ35MSLaE) (We'll miss you Paul), but their target browser is only Chrome Stable / Canary. Since I will get bonus cookie points üç™ for making things backwards-compatible, I just went all out.

## Setup
Install with `yarn install` or `npm install` and run `yarn start` or `npm start`.
The server should run on `localhost:3000` hosting files from `/dist/html`.
